### Project 
That's show a list of beers retrieved from brewerydb API and allow you to create your own beer 


### Architecture

The project was built using the React 17.0.1 and to manage the state was used the hooks. 
For items that were retrieved from API I used the local hook to store it, though to created beers the store was made inside the ContextAPI, because it is shared on the detail page as well. 

The tests were wroten using the react-testing-library.
